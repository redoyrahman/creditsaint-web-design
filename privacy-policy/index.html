			<li>What cookies are and how they are used;</li>
			<li>How your information is used;</li>

				<strong>What personally identifiable information does the Credit Saint Website collect from me?</strong><br />
			Credit Saint Website collects information in several ways. Some personal information is gathered when you register on the website. During the registration process, the Credit Saint Website requires that you create a username and password. At that time you may also be asked for demographic information about yourself, such as your birth date, gender, and mailing address. Other than your Mailing Address and Birth Date as any other information required to provide the specific service you requested, you are not required to provide any other information, but the more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. We may ask you for personal information at other times also, including (but not limited to) when you utilize a promotion sponsored by Credit Saint and/or one of our affiliates; when you make a purchase from the Credit Saint Website; and if you report a problem with our products and/or services. If you make contact with the Credit Saint Website and/or Credit Saint we may keep a record of that correspondence. Credit Saint Website may occasionally ask users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever Credit Saint Website collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.</li>
			<li><strong>What are cookies and how does Credit Saint Website use them?</strong><br />
			As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Credit Saint Website uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you.

			Generally, we use cookies to:

				<li>Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing the Credit Saint Website is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.</li>
				<li>To process the items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called ‘clickstream’ or ‘click trail’ and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant’s store.</li>
			</ol>

			<li><strong>How does the Credit Saint Website use my information?</strong><br />

			<li><strong>Who is collecting information?</strong><br />
			When you are using the Credit Saint Website and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Credit Saint and, if applicable, a Direct Business Affiliate, unless it is specifically stated otherwise.

If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Credit Saint and/or a Direct Business Affiliate, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.</li>

			<li><strong>How does the Credit Saint Website protect my personal and financial related information?</strong><br />
			Keeping your personal and financial information private is vitally important to us.<br /><br />
			
			Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements. But as with all personally identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties who are not Direct Business Affiliates of Credit Saint without your permission. Any user statistics that we may provide to non-direct affiliates regarding financial product or service usage on the Credit Saint Website are provided in the aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user.<br /><br />
			
			Please note that there are several places on the Credit Saint Website where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.</li>
			
			<li><strong>What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</strong><br />
			Your Credit Saint Website Account Information is password protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your Credit Saint Website Account Information by using your Credit Saint Website User ID and password.<br /><br />
			
			We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. The Credit Saint Website and Credit Saint will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your Credit Saint Website account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.<br /><br />
			
			When you give the Credit Saint Website personal information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information, such as to the United States or other countries. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of the country where you entered that information. Whenever the Credit Saint Website handles personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, the Credit Saint Website takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms and Conditions of Use and this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />
			
			Unfortunately, no communication — by internet, phone, mail or any other means — can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, the Credit Saint Website and Credit Saint cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</li>
			<li><strong>What about children’s privacy?</strong><br />
			Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us. The Credit Saint Website is a general audience web site. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. Credit Saint Website and Credit Saint does not offer products and services for purchase to children the age of 13, and does not share personal information about users or their children under the age of 13 with third parties.

			<li><strong>What else should I know about my privacy?</strong><br />
			Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.<br /><br />
			
			Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you’re online.</li>
